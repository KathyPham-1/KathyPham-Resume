        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Kathy Pham. I am a student at the University of California, Riverside. Currently, I am majoring in the General School of Education, otherwise known as GSOE. As such, I hope to become involved with the education system, whether it be within the vicinity of the classroom or outside of it. I greatly enjoy working with children and it has been a longtime dream of mine to work in the classroom or with education by itself. I am still undecided on whether I truly want to work in a classroom as a teacher or do something else such as counselling.<br><br>

        I have had several experiences working with children in the past, although not in formal situations. For example, during high school I often volunteered in the local library about 3 days a week. During this time, I often dealt with children and parents alike. Many of them had language barriers, coming from various countries and studying in the library in order to improve their English. As such, I was able to successfully recommend them books and led them around the library to help find the books they needed. During this time, I was able to strengthen my communication abilities and discovered my love for working with children. In addition, I also acted as a teacher’s assistant in an art school during the weekends. I helped to teach younger children how to draw properly and helped them to develop their own style. However, this classroom did not consist of kids of the same age like many conventional classes. This class consisted of kids of all ages, and I helped to instruct first graders and high schoolers. I helped to set up large projects and to give students the advice that they needed when they were at a loss of what to do with their art. It was during these times that I realized I enjoyed what I was doing and that I had a knack working with younger students.<br><br>

        Furthermore, I also do art commissions. As such, I have had a history of dealing with many clients, as well as learning how to adjust my prices and give people the product that they wish for. This particular job is not associated with anyone besides myself, as I have set up my own rules and my own work times. It would suffice to say that this is entirely self run. However my art career does not end there. I have also worked in creating art for a digital magazine, compiled with writing and art from various people around the world. During this project, I experienced working with a crew of people who compiled our work and donated the profits to charity. As far as creative work goes, art is not my only merit, as I have also done work with writing. I helped to write and edit an anthology of sorts, consisting of many short stories and poems. This book is entirely student made, and the proceedings went to our creative writing club, where we were able to fund for them and sell them online.
